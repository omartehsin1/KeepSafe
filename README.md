# KeepSafe
***Currently still in development***

A safety based app that allows users to share their live locations with people in their circle. The purpose of this app is to provide a sense of security for vulnerable people in threatening situations. Users who work or live in rough parts of the neighborhood are allowed to have peace of mind knowing that they have close friends or family member knowing that they are safe.



This project still needs work on UI and UX, the readme will continue to be updated as significant changes are made to the project.
